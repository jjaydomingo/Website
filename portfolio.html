			<h2 class="header"> HEALING | 6:54 AM	  </h2>
			<p class="caption"> Late July of 2021, my best friend, Cali, and I continued our yearly 15-mile hike to Point Sal Beach. Our form of "healing" ourselves and our proper "end of the summer" activity. This was especially sentimental since I was traveling to visit my family in Hawaii and moving into college shortly after coming back. </p>

			<p> I've been best friends with Cali since we were 16. She likes water polo, acai bowls from blenders, music, especially Tyler, the Creator, the DC universe, thrifting together, fashion, jewelry making, and comic books. She also likes me, if you care about that sort of thing. Cali is my living personification of the sun, a presence that can nourish. She em </p>

			<h2 class="header"> FRESH WATER PEARLS | 5:32 AM </h2>
			<p class="caption"> My aunt's backyard in Hawaii. I was able to visit my dad's hometown and the home he grew up in. It felt sentimental of the stories my dad would tell of what had changed from the last time he visited Hawaii, which was over 30 years ago. </p>

			<p> Visiting Hawaii was the most refreshing experience. However, what was difficult about visiting Hawaii was how not diet-friendly the meals my family had made for me was. Since I am allergic to fish, and most Asian Pacific Islander cuisine includes fish, I often ate rice and pineapples for dinner. </p>

We have watched each other grow up, starting kindergarten together and moving out for our first year of college on the same day. </p>

			<p class="caption"> My little sister, Rachel. We are two introverted "penguins" that had a month-and-a-half-long sleepover. There are certain people in my life where being around them, makes my depression be gone for the period of time I'm with them and Rachel has that ability. </p>


			<p> To be able to speak so softly and delicately; to be able to settle in the vibrations of their voice because they feel like home.   </p>

			<p class="caption"> A needed getaway trip. For my birthday, Cali, Michi, and I rented a cabin Airbnb in Big Bear to relax and detach ourselves from city life. At the time, there was nothing more soothing than being able to drink hot chocolate, make pancakes, and sit together outside for breakfast. </p>

			<p class="caption"> Charlize is the only person I know that would always be willing to watch the sunrise whenever asked. At the time of the picture, this was also my first time seeing Charlize within months due to living five hours apart from each other. </p>

			<p> Charlize is very grounding, having the ability to stabilize one-self and others, promoting greater well-being. </p>

			<p class="caption"> A photoshoot my friends and I had at a chapel. Daisy embodies such intelligence, also considering she attends Stanford University. Her wit is unmatched which made becoming friends in 7th grade very comforting since she loved to make people laugh. </p>

			<p> What is admirable about Daisy is her passion for science. She loves learning which is encouraging since she fuels one with dedication and enthusiasm for people to pursue their goals. </p>

			<h2 class="header"> CHASING WATERFALLS </h2>
			<p class="caption"> One of the first hikes I did while going back to my dad's hometown in Hawaii, and perhaps my all-time favorite hike of all, also one of the hardest hikes I have ever done. </p>
			<p> During this hike, since we had to hike through the rainforest, the trail was muddy and slippery which made it difficult to hike through. Continuing, when we got to the bottom of the waterfall, my shoes had fallen into the waterfall so I had to hike barefoot back. </p>

			<p class="caption"> A shopping spree in downtown. Aileen enables my shopping spree, which I am appreciative that she does. </p>
			<p> I appreciate Aileen's adventurous personality and I am very appreciative that she invites me to go explore with her. Simply getting lost in the city with no aim of going anywhere feels relaxing since exploring without intention we are able to explore all the nooks and crannies of the city. </p>

			<p class="caption"> My college roommate, Santi. His intelligence is unmatched and I always make fun of him for enjoying studying chemistry. Santi holds such wit, his bubbly personality makes it comforting to be around him, especially since he is always considerate. </p> 
			<p> Santi was one of the first people at college that had made me feel at home, which was especially difficult when he had moved back home to Keys Biscane. </p>

			<p class="caption"> A night out at the beach. Svara, Rachel, and I decided to relax at the beach at night as a reward for getting through finals. We were able to see the beach without tourists and experience it in a calming way. </p>
			<p> Svara exhibits nothing but strength and resilience. She has such maturity, and despite me being older than her, I view her as an older sister. Svara will always make sure somebody feels welcome when around her. One of Svara's most wholesome characteristics is her perfectly timed jokes, and sometimes her clumsiness. </p>

			<p class="caption"> Rina Sawayama concert at the Hollywood Palladium. Despite the bright neon lights, Laurah had almost fallen asleep, standing, at the concert. She also had never listened to a Rina Sawayama song beforehand but her wanting to watch the concert with Gina and me made it a fun experience nevertheless.</p>
			<p> Laurah's openmindedness makes it comforting to be with her. She is always willing to try and do new things. I went with her to get her first tattoo since she was encouraged by my own tattoos. She is a risk-taker, which is admirable. </p>

			<p class="caption"> Stargazing with my bestfriend. What sucks about living in Los Angeles is the inability to see the night sky due to light pollution, which this makes me miss home since one of my favorite activities is stargazing and listening to music with my best friends. </p>
			<p> This is a reminder to me that I do not want to live in the city for the majority of my life since I will always miss nature and its gifts. "Kiss the earth that birthed you."</p>

	<h2> A Year In Review </h2>
	<p> A short edit I made at the end of freshman year at college. My year in review was that it was very eventful, there was alot of change that I had to adjust to but I would not change it for the world since I had met some of the most coolest, kindnest, and loving people. </p>
